  ! The following function is a snippet from Fortran wiki and in public
  ! domain.
  ! 
  ! This is a simple function to search for an available unit.
  ! LUN_MIN and LUN_MAX define the range of possible LUNs to check.
  ! The UNIT value is returned by the function, and also by the optional
  ! argument. This allows the function to be used directly in an OPEN
  ! statement, and optionally save the result in a local variable.
  ! If no units are available, -1 is returned.
